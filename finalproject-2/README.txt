This project uses the Food-101 dataset to create an image classifier. Originally composed of 101 classes of different images, the model (available here - https://www.dropbox.com/s/y3y2qmc1vqr5puy/food_trained.h5?dl=0) was fit using 15 different classes on a 2.9ghz hex-core i9 Macbook Pro 15. On similar machines, a model can be made using the included jupyter notebook in 2-3 hours. A flask app was written to scrape data from various website to serve up predictions and information about food provide, however results my vary depending on the websites being scraped.
